# OmnidirectionalMotors-Repository

This repository works a little on some general concepts using real-time programming for embedded systems, in the creation of a robot with omnidirectional motor control using FreeRTOS on an STM32 BlackPill microcontroller. This code explores the concepts of: 

- Hardware configuration
- Task creation
- Task prioritization
- Queue creation
- Creating Binary Semaphores
- Interrupts 
- WatchDogs 
- Other...

Below you can see an image of the microcontroller pin configuration and the omnidirectional base assembled for the project. The project code and report can be found in the files available on this repository.
