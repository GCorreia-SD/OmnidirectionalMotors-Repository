# OmnidirectionalMotors-Repository

This repository works a little on some general concepts using real-time programming for embedded systems, in the creation of a robot with omnidirectional motor control using FreeRTOS on an STM32 BlackPill microcontroller. This code explores the concepts of: 

- Hardware configuration
- Task creation
- Task prioritization
- Queue creation
- Creating Binary Semaphores
- Interrupts 
- WatchDogs 
- Other...
